# Professional Portfolio

## Description

- For this project I want to create a portfio that a future employer could look at to learn about my talents, skills, and proficiency in certain areas. It will include an about me section, links to my projects, and how they can contact me.
- The website will be user friendly and responsive, and will change format when the window size is changed.
- During this project I learned a lot about CSS, and how different tags, sections, and actions affect the web page. I enjoyed it even though it was a struggle at times.
